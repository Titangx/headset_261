    for commit doesn't precede a link disconnection. This ensures that the
    subsequent re-connection in the post reboot DFU commit phase succeeds and
    DFU proceeds to successful completion. Especially required in iAP DFU use-
    case, where the recommended connection parameters for MFI accessories has
    connection/link supervision timeout (x) within 2sec <= x <= 6sec range. */
